# Spark-for-Machine-Learning-and-AI
This is a LinkedIn Learning course delivered by Dan Sullivan. 
In this course, discover how to work with this powerful platform for machine learning. 
Instructor Dan Sullivan discusses MLlib—the Spark machine learning library—which provides tools for data scientists and analysts who would rather find solutions to business problems than code, 
test, and maintain their own machine learning libraries. 
He shows how to use DataFrames to organize data structure, and he covers data preparation and 
the most commonly used types of machine learning algorithms: clustering, classification, regression, and recommendations.

Learning Objectives:
- Machine learning workflows
- Organizing data in DataFrames
- Preprocessing and data preparation steps for machine learning
- Clustering data
- Classification algorithms
- Regression methods available in Spark MLlib
- Common approaches to designing recommendation systems
